# chatbot
Aims to create a useable chatbot for club-members and interested spenders

## Technologies
Using LangChain to connect different components (routing to be added in the future)
Information about different "Vereine" are to be retrieved from a bookstack database (other places of ingestion should be possible in the future)
Weaviate as vector database for the information received
As chatbots should be fast, OpenAI would be used (although currently using tinyllama)
